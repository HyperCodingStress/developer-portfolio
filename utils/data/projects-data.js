        description: "I designed and developed a web-based project monitoring system (SIMPRO) for CV Indocitra using the Scrum methodology. The front-end was built with PHP and Bootstrap, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. The back-end utilizes SQL to manage project and financial data securely. The system features project management, partner management, invoice management, sector management, and procurement management modules. I conducted black-box testing in collaboration with CV Indocitra's finance manager. Despite challenges with tight deadlines and limited resources, the project was completed within 28 days, faster than the initial estimate of 35.5 days. SIMPRO now allows CV Indocitra's finance team to easily monitor and manage projects, improving transparency and efficiency.",

        description: 'I developed an e-commerce web application aimed at assisting a mall in growing its business projections and enabling mall managers to serve customers online. The system is designed with three primary roles: Admin, Staff, and Customer. The Admin can create staff accounts and update item IDs, while Staff have access to a login page. Customers can register, log in, and browse products. The project was built using Java, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming principles, and utilizes Firebase for the database, Android Studio for development, and MySQL or Firebase for storage solutions. The system is designed to be extensible and responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience..',

        description: 'I developed a bus reservation application as my final project for Hacktiv8, aimed at replacing the manual booking system used by bus companies. The app is built using Firebase for user authentication through Google Auth, allowing seamless login and registration. It includes five key screens: Splash Screen, Login, Register, Homepage, and Bus Details. The system efficiently handles passenger details, seat availability, price per seat, and generates invoices. I also packaged the app into an APK for easy installation. This solution significantly reduces human errors, saves time, and improves the overall customer experience.',
